# File Management System

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)

## Introduction

This Flutter project has successfully implemented a comprehensive file management system, utilizing Flutter Clean Architecture with BLoC state management. The project addresses key aspects such as ORM, 3-tier architecture, file management, user and group management, reporting, check-in/check-out, bulk check-in, transactions, authentication, authorization, and a responsive front-end with pagination, configuration, and enhanced security measures.

## Key Features

### 1. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

The project leverages ORM to facilitate seamless interaction between the application and the database, ensuring efficient data management.

### 2. 3-Tier Architecture

Following a robust three-tier architecture:

- **Front-end**: Developed using Flutter to provide a responsive cross-platform user interface.
- **Back-end**: Implements Clean Architecture principles for a modular and testable design, with BLoC as the state management solution. [Link to Backend Repository](https://github.com/yumnaqass/file-management-)

- **Database**: Stores information about files, users, groups, and transactions.

### 3. File Management

Users can add, categorize, and manage files within the system. Files are organized into groups, and access is controlled based on user roles.

### 4. User and Group Management

The system includes user and group management functionalities to regulate access and collaboration.

### 5. Reports

A reporting module has been implemented to generate insightful reports on reservation and editing activities, categorized by file or user.

### 6. Check-in and Check-out

The fundamental operations of check-in and check-out are seamlessly integrated, allowing users to reserve, modify, and revert files.

### 7. Bulk Check-in

Users have the capability to select multiple files and perform a bulk check-in operation, streamlining the process.

### 8. Transaction Management

The system ensures secure handling of transactions to prevent data corruption or loss.

### 9. Authentication

A robust authentication system is in place, requiring users to authenticate before accessing the system.

### 10. Authorization

Different user roles have distinct permissions, ensuring proper access control and data security.

### 11. Front-end (Flutter)

The project's front-end is developed using Flutter Clean Architecture, incorporating BLoC for efficient state management.

### 12. Pagination

Pagination is implemented for efficient data handling, especially when dealing with a large number of files.

### 13. Configuration

The system allows for easy configuration to adapt to various deployment environments.

### 14. Enhanced Security

Security measures have been implemented across the system, emphasizing the protection of user data and preventing unauthorized access.
