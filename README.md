# File Management Project

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-yellow)

## Introduction

This Flutter project aims to create a file management system that facilitates collaboration among a group of users. The primary goal is to ensure that two users cannot write concurrently to the same file. The project is currently in progress, and active development is ongoing.

## Project Overview

The system allows users to:

1. **Web-Based System**: Users can add their files to the system and categorize them as either free or in use by a specific user.

2. **File Organization**: Files are organized into groups, restricting user access to only those files belonging to specified groups.

3. **Check-in and Check-out**: The fundamental use cases involve check-in and check-out operations. Check-in allows a user to reserve a free file, download it, make modifications, and then upload the modified file. Check-out enables a user to revert the modified file, replacing the old version and returning it to a free state.

4. **Batch Check-in**: Users can select multiple files and perform a check-in operation. The system ensures that all selected files are free before reserving them.

5. **Concurrency Control**: The system guarantees that two users cannot reserve the same file simultaneously.

## Features in Progress

- **Check-in/Check-out Enhancements**: Ongoing work to refine the check-in and check-out functionalities for improved user experience.

- **Reporting Module**: Development of a reporting module to generate reports on reservation and editing activities, categorized by file or user.
